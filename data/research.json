Osteocytes, the most abundant cells in bone, are in direct contact with implants; however, the interaction between osteocytes and wear particles remains largely unelucidated. In the present study, in vivo results showed that titanium (Ti) nanoparticles (with diameters of 40 nm and 800 nm) markedly triggered bone destruction and increased osteocytes death, and this effect was mitigated by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Our in vitro experiments revealed that Ti nanoparticles significantly inhibited the viability of osteocytes MLO-Y4, and induced cell death. Meanwhile, Ti nanoparticles remarkably promoted ferroptosis in MLO-Y4 cells, as evidenced by iron overload, lipid peroxidation accumulation, downregulated protein expressions of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Notably, this ferroptotic response was associated with enhanced ferritinophagy and degradation of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), since inhibition of ferritinophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) alleviated Ti nanoparticles-induced ferroptosis. Additionally, Ti nanoparticles significantly suppressed the erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) pathway; the Nrf2-specific activator sulforaphane (SFN) reversed Ti nanoparticles-induced Fe²⁺ accumulation and lipid peroxidation, attenuated ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, and thereby restored the viability of MLO-Y4 cells. Collectively, these findings identify ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis as a novel mechanism underlying Ti nanoparticles-induced osteocytes death, and demonstrate that the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is essential for regulating Ti nanoparticles-induced ferritinophagy and ferroptosis.

    "abstract_en": "Glucosinolates (GSLs) are secondary metabolites popularly existing in Brassicaceae. However, the role and regulation of GSLs in environmental stress response remain ambiguous. Here, Methylthioalkylmalate synthase 1 (BolMAM1), a GSL biosynthesis-associated gene, was identified in broccoli. The overexpression of BolMAM1 enhanced both salt and drought tolerance in broccoli, along with an increase in aliphatic GSLs, such as 2(R)-hydroxy-3-butenyl GSL (progoitrin). Progoitrin could induce ABA accumulation in vitro. Consistently, ABA homoeostasis was modulated to accumulate more ABA in OEX-BolMAM1 transgenic broccoli. Moreover, sulforaphane (SFN), one of the hydrolysates of aliphatic GSLs, also exhibited accelerated accumulation in OEX-BolMAM1 transgenic broccoli. External application of SFN could rapidly induce stomatal closure. Furthermore, BolMYB28 was demonstrated to directly bind to the promoter of BolMAM1 and activate its transcription. These results indicated that BolMYB28-BolMAM1 confers tolerance to salt and drought stresses mainly by accelerating the biosynthesis of certain specific aliphatic GSLs. Progoitrin is a newly reported GSL positively regulating ABA accumulation. SFN may act as a signaling molecule to regulate stomatal behavior.

Various NRF2 binding partners and cofactors specific to ARE genes are involved in this regulation, and are potentially condition-specific (e.g., type of stressor) and dependent on non-canonical signaling pathways (i.e., crosstalk). Here, we explored the quantitative relationship between NRF2 and sulfiredoxin 1 (SRXN1), a bona fide key NRF2 target gene. We developed a semi-mechanistic mathematical model based on time course experimental data of NRF2 and SRXN1 protein expression in HepG2 cells following single or repeated exposure to NRF2 activating soft electrophiles (sulforaphane, andrographolide, ethacrynic acid or CDDO-me) at a wide concentration range. We showed that a nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach with partially hierarchical parameters accurately captures the observed experimental dynamics. Our analysis highlights that NRF2 requires a cofactor or post-translational modification to regulate its activity as a transcription factor. Moreover, this modulation of the transcription factor activity of NRF2 is time-, compound- and exposure scenario specific.

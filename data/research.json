    "pub_date": "2026-Jan",
    "abstract_en": "Wear particles-induced osteolysis is the primary cause of aseptic loosening and subsequent joint replacement failure. Osteocytes, the most abundant cells in bone, are in direct contact with implants; however, the interaction between osteocytes and wear particles remains largely unelucidated. In the present study, in vivo results showed that titanium (Ti) nanoparticles (with diameters of 40 nm and 800 nm) markedly triggered bone destruction and increased osteocytes death, and this effect was mitigated by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Our in vitro experiments revealed that Ti nanoparticles significantly inhibited the viability of osteocytes MLO-Y4, and induced cell death. Meanwhile, Ti nanoparticles remarkably promoted ferroptosis in MLO-Y4 cells, as evidenced by iron overload, lipid peroxidation accumulation, downregulated protein expressions of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Notably, this ferroptotic response was associated with enhanced ferritinophagy and degradation of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), since inhibition of ferritinophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) alleviated Ti nanoparticles-induced ferroptosis. Additionally, Ti nanoparticles significantly suppressed the erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) pathway; the Nrf2-specific activator sulforaphane (SFN) reversed Ti nanoparticles-induced Fe²⁺ accumulation and lipid peroxidation, attenuated ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, and thereby restored the viability of MLO-Y4 cells. Collectively, these findings identify ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis as a novel mechanism underlying Ti nanoparticles-induced osteocytes death, and demonstrate that the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is essential for regulating Ti nanoparticles-induced ferritinophagy and ferroptosis. These results further suggest that targeting the Nrf2/HO-1pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing or alleviating ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis in wear particles-related osteoclastogenesis and periprosthetic osteolysis.",

    "pub_date": "2026-Jan",
    "abstract_en": "Glucosinolates (GSLs) are secondary metabolites popularly existing in Brassicaceae. However, the role and regulation of GSLs in environmental stress response remain ambiguous. Here, Methylthioalkylmalate synthase 1 (BolMAM1), a GSL biosynthesis-associated gene, was identified in broccoli. The overexpression of BolMAM1 enhanced both salt and drought tolerance in broccoli, along with an increase in aliphatic GSLs, such as 2(R)-hydroxy-3-butenyl GSL (progoitrin). Progoitrin could induce ABA accumulation in vitro. Consistently, ABA homoeostasis was modulated to accumulate more ABA in OEX-BolMAM1 transgenic broccoli. Moreover, sulforaphane (SFN), one of the hydrolysates of aliphatic GSLs, also exhibited accelerated accumulation in OEX-BolMAM1 transgenic broccoli. External application of SFN could rapidly induce stomatal closure. Furthermore, BolMYB28 was demonstrated to directly bind to the promoter of BolMAM1 and activate its transcription. These results indicated that BolMYB28-BolMAM1 confers tolerance to salt and drought stresses mainly by accelerating the biosynthesis of certain specific aliphatic GSLs. Progoitrin is a newly reported GSL positively regulating ABA accumulation. SFN may act as a signaling molecule to regulate stomatal behavior. These findings reveal the role of BolMYB28-BolMAM1 in abiotic stress response via regulating aliphatic GSL biosynthesis, and suggest the applications of progoitrin and SFN as natural defence factors to resist abiotic stresses in plants.",

    "abstract_en": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a vital role in the regulation of various antioxidant response element (ARE) genes, which control physiological processes such as oxidative stress, autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis to maintain cellular homeostasis. It is not understood in detail how the NRF2 program acquires its flexibility with respect to regulation of its downstream targets. Various NRF2 binding partners and cofactors specific to ARE genes are involved in this regulation, and are potentially condition-specific (e.g., type of stressor) and dependent on non-canonical signaling pathways (i.e., crosstalk). Here, we explored the quantitative relationship between NRF2 and sulfiredoxin 1 (SRXN1), a bona fide key NRF2 target gene. We developed a semi-mechanistic mathematical model based on time course experimental data of NRF2 and SRXN1 protein expression in HepG2 cells following single or repeated exposure to NRF2 activating soft electrophiles (sulforaphane, andrographolide, ethacrynic acid or CDDO-me) at a wide concentration range. We showed that a nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach with partially hierarchical parameters accurately captures the observed experimental dynamics. Our analysis highlights that NRF2 requires a cofactor or post-translational modification to regulate its activity as a transcription factor. Moreover, this modulation of the transcription factor activity of NRF2 is time-, compound- and exposure scenario specific. We conclude that a complete understanding of NRF2-mediated ARE genes activation requires detailed dynamic information on NRF2 binding partners and cofactors.",

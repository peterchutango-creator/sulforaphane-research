Natural products like magnolol and sulforaphane, especially their synthetic hybrid, have shown promising antitumor activity. To develop more potent agents, we designed and synthesized 15 novel magnolol-sulforaphane hybrid analogues and evaluated their anticancer efficacy.

Although oxidative stress and ferroptosis are implicated in its pathogenesis, targeted therapies are not available for TTS. We demonstrate that sulforaphane (SFN), a natural Nrf2 activator, mitigates TTS-related injury in isoproterenol-induced rat models and AC16 cardiomyocytes. Isoproterenol induced ferroptosis and oxidative stress by impairing Nrf2 signaling. SFN treatment restored myocardial structure and function while enhancing antioxidant capacity, reducing mitochondrial damage, and suppressing ferroptosis markers. Additionally, similar to Fer-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor), SFN reduced intracellular ferrous levels but uniquely activated Nrf2-driven endogenous defenses. Notably, Nrf2 inhibition abrogated the benefits of SFN in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. These findings highlight SFN as a dual-action therapeutic for TTS, simultaneously targeting oxidative stress and ferroptosis via Nrf2 activation. The therapeutic efficacy of SFN, combined with endogenous pathway modulation, underscores its translational potential for improving TTS outcomes.",

Sulforaphane (SFN), a potent antioxidant, activates the SIRT1 pathway, enhancing cellular stress resistance and survival. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of SFN against cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced damage in human airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and in mouse lungs, focusing on its role in upregulating SIRT1 expression. BEAS-2B cells were treated with CSE and SFN, and cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. Cellular senescence was assessed using the SA-β-gal assay and the expression of genes associated with senescence (p16 and p21). The expression levels of SIRT1, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α), GPX4, and SLC7A11 were quantified using qRT-PCR. Additionally, ROS production, GSH and MDA levels, and iron content were measured. An emphysema mouse model was induced by intraperitoneal administration of CSE (7.2 mg/kg) alone or in combination with SFN (10.2 mg/kg) over 28 days, and subsequent histopathological changes were evaluated. Our findings revealed that SFN co-treatment effectively mitigated CSE-induced cytotoxicity, senescence, and SASP cytokine secretion, as well as the pronounced emphysematous changes in lung tissues. Furthermore, SFN reversed CSE-induced downregulation of SIRT1 and upregulation of NF-κB. Notably, SFN also inhibited CSE-induced ferroptosis by increasing GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression while reducing iron and MDA levels.

Integrative network pharmacology and proteomics were utilized to investigate the underlying mechanisms of SFN in intrinsic skin aging. Fifty-one anti-aging targets of SFN were identified, highlighting its promising regulatory impact on the aging process. Based on an 18-month-old natural aging mouse model, significant alleviation in skin structure, redox homeostasis, and immune cell composition was noted after 2 months of SFN supplementation. Additionally, proteomic analysis demonstrated that SFN reversed the proteomic profile of intrinsic skin aging, with 233 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified in SFN-fed aging mice. Of note, the up-regulated DEPs were highly enriched in the apelin signaling pathway (p = 0.010). Furthermore, immune cell infiltration and whole blood cell analysis revealed that SFN rescued T cells depletion in dermal tissue, which was strongly correlated with DEPs enriched in the SFN-activated apelin signaling pathway.

This result showed that TPT exposure induced significantly (P < 0.05) hepatotoxicity, evidenced by increasing hepatic total bile acid (TBA) and total cholesterol levels, while upregulating Hsp70/90 and downregulating lysozyme gene expression. SFN supplementation reduced TBA accumulation, normalized Hsp90 and lysozyme expression, mitigating TPT-induced lipid dysregulation and immunosuppression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TPT exposure activated lipid metabolism pathways (PPAR signaling and cholesterol metabolism), but suppressed immune-related pathways.

However, the role of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolism in the anti-UC mechanisms of SFN remains inadequately understood. In this study, we observed that SFN administration significantly improved the pathological phenotype, restored gut barrier integrity, and reduced colon inflammation in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Gut microbiota analysis illustrated that SFN administration rebalances the alterations in gut microbiota composition, including genera such as Turicibacter, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides, in DSS-induced mice. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics analysis indicated that the levels of microbial arachidonic acid metabolism, as well as the metabolism of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, and glutathione metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract, were significantly altered in DSS-induced mice. Interestingly, SFN treatment significantly restore the alterations in glutathione metabolism and the levels of associated metabolites. Additionally, we observed that the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, regulated by glutathione metabolism, was inhibited in the colon of DSS-induced mice following SFN treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that SFN can alleviate DSS-induced colitis in mice by restoring dysregulated gut microbiota and glutathione metabolism, thereby modulating the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, enhancing intestinal barrier function and reducing colonic inflammation.

SFN-NLPs significantly reduced EAC tumor volume, viable cell count, and tumor marker levels, while prolonging survival more effectively than free SFN. SFN-NLPs modulated key molecular pathways by suppressing inflammatory gene expression (NF-κB, COX-2) and shifting the balance toward apoptosis via upregulation of TP53 and Bax and concomitant downregulation of Bcl-2. Regarding liver integrity, SFN-NLPs significantly reduced DNA fragmentation and hepatic oxidative stress, while modulating systemic inflammation through reductions in total leukocyte count, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein. In addition, SFN-NLPs conferred superior protection against both histopathological and ultrastructural liver damage.

To investigate the mechanism of action of SFN in gastric cancer. The antitumor effects of SFN were comprehensively assessed in vitro and in vivo, followed by sequencing analysis to identify the targeted lncRNA. Subsequently, the mechanical verification experiments were carried out to determine the upstream and downstream regulatory components involved in the STAT3-CKMT2-AS1 regulatory axis. We demonstrated that SFN strongly inhibits GC. SFN downregulated the expression of the lncRNA CKMT2-AS1. Elevated expression levels of CKMT2-AS1 in human GC tissues are correlated with poor patient survival rates. Knockdown of CKMT2-AS1 significantly inhibited GC proliferation and migration both in vivo and in vitro, whereas CKMT2-AS1 overexpression enhanced malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, we identified STAT3 as the transcriptional activator driving CKMT2-AS1 expression, with SFN directly binding to, and inhibiting, STAT3 phosphorylation to decrease its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, cytoplasmic CKMT2-AS1 competitively adsorbs miR-451a, leading to the expression of PSMB8, ultimately promoting the progression of the malignant phenotype of GC. Moreover, we discovered that CKMT2-AS1 directly binds to the RNA-binding protein (RBP) AIMP1, promoting ubiquitination-mediated degradation of AIMP1 protein via the proteasomal pathway.

However, its therapeutic efficacy remains controversial, and the pharmacological mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Eligible randomized controlled trials were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Review Manager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis and bias risk assessment. Network pharmacology, Mendelian randomization, GEO data analyses, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation were employed to explore the mechanisms of sulforaphane in ASD. Six trials involving 333 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results demonstrated that both 4-5 weeks and 8-10 weeks of sulforaphane supplementation significantly decreased the scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale compared to placebo controls. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse events. Network pharmacology identified 10 core targets of sulforaphane in ASD, including AKT1, EGFR, HSP90AA1, SRC, CASP3, STAT1, MAPK1, MMP9, MAPK8, and JAK2. These targets were implicated in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, Chemical carcinogenesis - reactive oxygen species, TNF signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, mTOR signaling pathway, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Mendelian randomization further revealed an inverse association between STAT1 levels and ASD risk. GEO transcriptomic data provided independent validation for the network pharmacology predictions. The binding energies between sulforaphane and the top 10 core targets are all ≤ -4.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulations further validated the stable interaction between MMP-9 and sulforaphane. Sulforaphane may serve as an efficacious and safe adjunctive therapy for ASD, mediated by its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects along with the modulation of autophagy. CRD42025635045.",

Sulforaphane (SFN), a phytochemical present in crucifers, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, yet its influences on immune cell activation as well as in graft survival are still unknown. Thus, the aim was to evaluate SFN's effect, and to improve efficacy, efficiency, and availability, it was incorporated into thermosensitive polymeric hydrogels, to prevent AR in skin transplant (Tx) model mice. A thermosensitive hydrogel containing SFN (0.1%) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (0.5%) dispersed in a poloxamer matrix (PL407 at 20% w/v) was developed (GS-PL407 20%, HA and SFN) and characterized as a liquid-viscous hydrogel. The fully MHC-incompatible skin Tx procedure was performed by using donor skin Balb/c mice, transplanted into C57BL/6 recipient mice. The cytotoxicity test of GS was performed using in vitro assays with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC). Treatment of BMDC with GS for 24 h presents no cytotoxicity. Untreated allograft mice present 100% of graft loss at day 9 post Tx. Remarkably, subcutaneous GS injection every 3 days promoted 80% of allograft survival for more than 14 days when compared with untreated recipients (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Histological analysis showed a lower level of inflammatory cells in the skin Tx of GS-treated mice. Flow cytometry analysis of draining lymph nodes at day 5 post Tx revealed that GS treatment reduced the frequency of DC and subtypes and function of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In vitro GS-treated lipopolysaccharide-activated BMDC present less activation of costimulatory markers.

With the aiming to enhance their therapeutic potential against inflammatory diseases. Novel monovalent SFN-glycoconjugates with mannose (Man) and fucose (0Fuc) were developed and tested for their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties in DCs from healthy donors under chronic LPS exposure. By leveraging therapeutic strategies, SFN-glycoconjugates significantly improved the solubility and bioavailability of SFN, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional delivery methods. Monocyte-derived DCs were treated with SFN-glycoconjugates and subsequently exposed to a chronic inflammatory environment induced by LPS. Our results showed that SFN-glycoconjugates enhance effectiveness in suppressing inflammation by targeting the p65 NF-κB pathway, without affecting MAPK signalling. SFN-glycoconjugates induce a tolerogenic immune response, characterized by increased IL-10 production and enhanced regulatory T- and B-cell proliferation. These effects surpass those of p65 NF-κB inhibition alone, highlighting a distinct and potent regulatory mechanism independent of MAPK pathways. The integration of food therapeutic strategies not only enhances the stability and delivery of bioactive compounds but also broadens their potential applications in functional foods and therapeutic approaches. In particular, SFN-glycoconjugates represent a promising option as biologically active compounds for inflammatory diseases, offering enhanced anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects through optimized delivery systems and the activation of specific molecular pathways.",

    "abstract_en": "Sulforaphane (SFN) plays a vital role in many types of cancer as a natural extract from plants. However, whether SFN can inhibit gastric carcinogenesis by regulating the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis is unclear. In the current work, the significantly differentially expressed lncRNA PSMB8AS1 was obtained by performing high-throughput sequencing of gastric cancer cells treated with SFN. The qRT-PCR assay results confirmed the inhibitory effect of SFN on PSM8AS1. Subsequently, using gastric cancer data from TCGA and 11 pairs of clinical samples from gastric and paracancerous tissues, we found that PSMB8-AS1 was upregulated in gastric cancer, and high expression of PSMB8-AS1 was associated with low survival of patients with gastric cancer. MTT, cell colony formation, scratch healing, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR assays showed that the knockdown of PSMB8-AS1 significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells as well as promoted apoptosis. Dual luciferase reporter gene and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay confirmed that PSMB8-AS1 can function as the molecular sponge for miR-888-5p. Meanwhile, bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-888-5p regulates SLC4A7. Overexpression of miR-888-5p or knockdown of SLC4A7 reduced the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. In addition, rescue experiments confirmed that the inhibitory effects of the knockdown of PSMB8-AS1 or the knockdown of SLC4A7 on the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells could be reversed by miR-888-5p inhibitor treatment. Subcutaneous tumor formation experiments in nude mice demonstrated that the tumor volume of nude mice transplanted with PSMB8-AS1-knockdown gastric cancer cells was significantly reduced compared with that of the control group. Transcription factors can usually bind to the promoter regions of lncRNAs and regulate the transcription of lncRNAs. We demonstrated through website prediction and experiments that SFN can inhibit the level of PSMB8-AS1 by regulating the transcription factor YY1. These results suggest that SFN inhibits gastric cancer growth through the YY1/PSMB8-AS1/miR-888-5p/SLC4A7 axis.

Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate that has robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to identify the pharmacological effects and therapeutic mechanisms of SFN in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. The role of SFN in ALI was investigated using a mouse model of LPS-induced ALI. Briefly, eighteen mice were divided into three groups: control, LPS, and LPS + SFN, which were intraperitoneally injected for 2 days before LPS treatment. 24 h after the LPS injection, blood and liver tissues were collected for further analysis. The hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed a lot of visible necrosis areas, inflammatory cell infiltration, and congestion in liver. Meanwhile, Ly6G and F4/80 staining showed increased infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in liver, these results indicated that LPS induced sever ALI. As inflammatory response plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI, we detected the occurrence of pyroptosis in liver by ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. The results showed that pyroptosis was significantly promoted by LPS, as indicated by gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, revealing the activation of pyroptosis, interleukin (IL)-1 production, IL-18 production, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Then, we explored the effect of SFN on LPS-induced ALI. The results showed that SFN obviously reduced LPS-induced plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase level, pathological injuries and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells, indicating protective effect of SFN on ALI. Furthermore, SFN also showed robust effect on LPS-induced inflammatory response in liver, as reflected by suppressing the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and downregulating mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α in liver of LPS treated mice. Furthermore, SFN blocked hepatocyte pyroptosis, and suppressed plasma IL-1β and IL-18 levels of LPS treated mice. Mechanistically, SFN selectively activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling to mediate pyroptotic cell death. SFN also reversed the inhibited superoxide dismutase activity and induced malondialdehyde content in liver of LPS exposed mice.

Adjunctive therapies to augment exercise effects may overcome these deficits. Sulforaphane (SFN), a phytochemical from cruciferous vegetables, stimulates NRF2. This study tested the hypothesis that combining acute exercise (in vivo stimulus) with ex vivo SFN treatment would induce greater NRF2 activation and signaling in older adults compared to either treatment alone. Twenty-five older adults (12 men, 13 women; mean age: 67 ± 5 years) performed 30-min cycling exercise (AET). Blood was drawn before and immediately after the AET to isolate PBMCs and incubate with and without SFN (5 µM) treatment (four conditions: DMSO (CON), SFN, exercise (EX), and EX + SFN). PBMCs were harvested after 2-h or 5-h incubation for measures of NRF2 or gene expression for NQO1, HO-1, GR, and GCLC targets, respectively. All treatments (SFN, EX, EX + SFN) increased NRF2 activation compared to CON (p < 0.05). The response to EX + SFN was significantly greater than either SFN or EX alone (2.1-fold versus 1.5-fold, p = 0.01). SFN stimulation resulted in a significant upregulation of all four genes compared to control (p < 0.001). EX + SFN treatment stimulated a greater increase in gene expression compared to EX (p < 0.05); however, SFN did not differ statistically from EX + SFN, suggesting a possible ceiling effect of the SFN concentration in terms of gene expression. There were no significant sex differences in any of the responses. These data suggest that combining exercise with SFN may amplify the strength of NRF2/ARE redox signaling in older adults.

Furthermore, the effects of SFN on macrophage polarization were investigated in vitro, and RNA sequencing was used to explore the mechanisms by which SFN regulates macrophage polarization in vivo. Finally, an ex vivo human pathological tendon culture system was employed to explore the therapeutic effects of SFN on tendinopathic lesions. In this study, we found that SFN modulated the polarization of M1 macrophages towards M2 macrophages, thereby effectively modulating the inflammatory response. RNA sequencing and Western blot analyses indicated that the effect of SFN was mediated through the JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway. In a collagenase-induced mouse model of tendinopathy, local injection of SFN led to a significant improvement in tendon tissue structure, with the collagen matrix restoring its natural dense parallel arrangement. Furthermore, there was an increase in local M2 macrophages and a decrease in M1 macrophages, which promoted the resolution of inflammation. Finally, the immunomodulatory effect of SFN on macrophages was also validated in tendon tissue from patients with tendinopathy.

We only analyzed studies that combined its epigenetic effects and anticancer activities due to the multitude of studies on SFN over the past few years. We found that SFN is able to regulate epigenetic mechanisms and promote the prevention and treatment of several cancers. Definitely, it prevents tumor growth and acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, and a microRNA regulator in several cancers. These epigenetic regulations lead indirectly to a hyperregulation or deregulation of the expression of genes involved in carcinogenesis. SFN hasn't any major epigenetic effect on normal cells.

    "abstract_en": "Broccoli sprout extract is rich in phenolic compounds and sulforaphane (SFN) and the gastrointestinal digestion process can affect the bioaccessibility of these substances. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity and the content of total phenolic compounds (TPC) and SFN in broccoli sprout extract before and during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (GID). The antioxidant capacity was determined using different assays (FRAP, ABTS and DPPH), and the TPC and sulforaphane content was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu method and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. The in vitro digestion analyses followed the INFOGEST 2.0 protocol. Additionally, microbiological characterization and chemical composition analysis of broccoli sprouts were conducted. The microbiological analyses indicated that the sprouts were safe for consumption, with high amounts of TPC, antioxidant capacity, and SFN content. The TPC content decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after GID, from 1740.0 μg eq. GAE/g before digestion to 536.5 μg eq. GAE/g in the gastric phase and 211.0 μg eq. GAE/g in the enteric phase. The antioxidant capacity also decreased significantly after simulated digestion compared to initial values. A lower (p < 0.001) SFN content was identified in the gastric phase (18.6 mg/g) compared to the intestinal phase (27.8 mg/g), although both showed lower SFN levels than the undigested sample, which contained 72.2 mg/g of SFN. In conclusion, simulated digestion significantly reduced the amount of TPC and SFN, likely due to degradation or biotransformation of the compounds under digestion conditions.",
    "explanation_zh": "這項研究對於健康和疾病預防有一定的啟示，特別是青花椰菜的營養價值。青花椰菜芽提取物富含抗氧化劑和蘿蔔硫素，這些成分可能對人體有益。然而，這些有益成分在消化過程中會受到影響，這意味著我們在攝取這些食物時，可能無法完全獲得它們的健康效益。了解這些變化有助於我們更好地利用青花椰菜的營養，並可能促進健康的飲食選擇。 這項研究的主題是評估青花椰菜芽提取物的抗氧化能力以及在模擬腸胃消化過程中，總酚類化合物和蘿蔔硫素的含量變化。研究者使用了多種方法來測量這些成分，包括FRAP、ABTS和DPPH等抗氧化測試，並透過Folin-Ciocalteu方法和高效液相色譜（HPLC）來測定總酚類化合物和蘿蔔硫素的含量。這些分析遵循了INFOGEST 2.0的模擬消化協議。 研究中還進行了青花椰菜芽的微生物特徵分析和化學成分分析，結果顯示這些芽在食用上是安全的，並且含有高量的總酚類化合物、抗氧化能力和蘿蔔硫素。然而，研究發現經過模擬消化後，總酚類化合物的含量顯著下降，從消化前的1740.0 μg eq. GAE/g降至胃相的536.5 μg eq. GAE/g和腸相的211.0 μg eq. GAE/g。此外，抗氧化能力也顯著下降。雖然腸相的蘿蔔硫素含量高於胃相，但兩者的含量都低於未消化樣本的72.2 mg/g。總的來說，模擬消化過程顯著降低了總酚類化合物和蘿蔔硫素的含量，這可能是由於在消化條件下的降解或生物轉化所致。",

    "abstract_en": "T he sulforaphane production of wild-type Lactobacillus plantarum CR12 (L. plantarum CR12) is limited. Researchers found that adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) technology can enhance the production of microorganism by altering the growth environment of microorganisms. However, the effectiveness of enhancing the transformation function of L. plantarum CR12 and the safety of the adaptive strain are unknown. To clarify the above problem, ALE technology was used to enhance the sulforaphane conversion rate of L. plantarum CR12. The results showed that the glucoraphanin conversion rate, sulforaphane production rate, and sulforaphane conversion efficiency of adaptive strain were significantly higher than those of the wild-type strain. The adaptive strain could produce sulforaphane in vivo and regulate the gut microbiota structure. The genomes showed that the adaptive strain consists of a 4,165,885 bp chromosome with a GC content of 36.8%, encoding 4172 protein-coding genes. Compared with the wild-type strain, the adaptive strain expresses more glycoside hydrolases and glycosyl transferases, indicating that the adaptive strain possesses higher carbohydrate metabolic capability. Genes related to glucoraphanin metabolism (cliT, bglF, and bglA) were detected in both the genomes of the wild-type strain and adaptive strain, indicating that both the wild-type strain and adaptive strain possess sulforaphane production capabilities. Therefore, the adaptive strain can be safely used to increase the in vivo production of sulforaphane, ultimately improving human health. This research is aimed at providing genetic evidence for further formulating rational genetic engineering strategies to transform the wild-type strain into an overproducer.",

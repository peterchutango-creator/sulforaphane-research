Isoproterenol induced ferroptosis and oxidative stress by impairing Nrf2 signaling. SFN treatment restored myocardial structure and function while enhancing antioxidant capacity, reducing mitochondrial damage, and suppressing ferroptosis markers.

Integrative network pharmacology and proteomics were utilized to investigate the underlying mechanisms of SFN in intrinsic skin aging. Fifty-one anti-aging targets of SFN were identified, highlighting its promising regulatory impact on the aging process. Based on an 18-month-old natural aging mouse model, significant alleviation in skin structure, redox homeostasis, and immune cell composition was noted after 2 months of SFN supplementation. Additionally, proteomic analysis demonstrated that SFN reversed the proteomic profile of intrinsic skin aging, with 233 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified in SFN-fed aging mice. Of note, the up-regulated DEPs were highly enriched in the apelin signaling pathway (p = 0.010).

In this study, we observed that SFN administration significantly improved the pathological phenotype, restored gut barrier integrity, and reduced colon inflammation in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Gut microbiota analysis illustrated that SFN administration rebalances the alterations in gut microbiota composition, including genera such as Turicibacter, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides, in DSS-induced mice. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics analysis indicated that the levels of microbial arachidonic acid metabolism, as well as the metabolism of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, and glutathione metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract, were significantly altered in DSS-induced mice. Interestingly, SFN treatment significantly restore the alterations in glutathione metabolism and the levels of associated metabolites. Additionally, we observed that the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, regulated by glutathione metabolism, was inhibited in the colon of DSS-induced mice following SFN treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that SFN can alleviate DSS-induced colitis in mice by restoring dysregulated gut microbiota and glutathione metabolism, thereby modulating the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, enhancing intestinal barrier function and reducing colonic inflammation.

Ninety female Swiss albino mice were allocated into six groups: (1) untreated control, (2) SFN alone (50 mg/kg/day, orally), (3) SFN-NLPs alone (50 mg/kg/day, orally), (4) EAC-bearing mice (2.5 × 10⁶ cells, intraperitoneally), (5) EAC + SFN, and (6) EAC + SFN-NLPs. with treatment lasting 20 days in tumor-bearing groups. SFN-NLPs significantly reduced EAC tumor volume, viable cell count, and tumor marker levels, while prolonging survival more effectively than free SFN. SFN-NLPs modulated key molecular pathways by suppressing inflammatory gene expression (NF-κB, COX-2) and shifting the balance toward apoptosis via upregulation of TP53 and Bax and concomitant downregulation of Bcl-2. Regarding liver integrity, SFN-NLPs significantly reduced DNA fragmentation and hepatic oxidative stress, while modulating systemic inflammation through reductions in total leukocyte count, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein. In addition, SFN-NLPs conferred superior protection against both histopathological and ultrastructural liver damage.

Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural isothiocyanate, exhibits antitumor activity; however, its molecular mechanisms of action in GC remain unclear. To investigate the mechanism of action of SFN in gastric cancer. The antitumor effects of SFN were comprehensively assessed in vitro and in vivo, followed by sequencing analysis to identify the targeted lncRNA. Subsequently, the mechanical verification experiments were carried out to determine the upstream and downstream regulatory components involved in the STAT3-CKMT2-AS1 regulatory axis. We demonstrated that SFN strongly inhibits GC. SFN downregulated the expression of the lncRNA CKMT2-AS1. Elevated expression levels of CKMT2-AS1 in human GC tissues are correlated with poor patient survival rates. Knockdown of CKMT2-AS1 significantly inhibited GC proliferation and migration both in vivo and in vitro, whereas CKMT2-AS1 overexpression enhanced malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, we identified STAT3 as the transcriptional activator driving CKMT2-AS1 expression, with SFN directly binding to, and inhibiting, STAT3 phosphorylation to decrease its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, cytoplasmic CKMT2-AS1 competitively adsorbs miR-451a, leading to the expression of PSMB8, ultimately promoting the progression of the malignant phenotype of GC. Moreover, we discovered that CKMT2-AS1 directly binds to the RNA-binding protein (RBP) AIMP1, promoting ubiquitination-mediated degradation of AIMP1 protein via the proteasomal pathway. The highly expressed AIMP1 protein, in turn, inhibits the phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is hyperactivated in virtually all solid tumors.

Eligible randomized controlled trials were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Review Manager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis and bias risk assessment. Network pharmacology, Mendelian randomization, GEO data analyses, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation were employed to explore the mechanisms of sulforaphane in ASD. Six trials involving 333 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results demonstrated that both 4-5 weeks and 8-10 weeks of sulforaphane supplementation significantly decreased the scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale compared to placebo controls. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse events. Network pharmacology identified 10 core targets of sulforaphane in ASD, including AKT1, EGFR, HSP90AA1, SRC, CASP3, STAT1, MAPK1, MMP9, MAPK8, and JAK2. These targets were implicated in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, Chemical carcinogenesis - reactive oxygen species, TNF signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, mTOR signaling pathway, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Mendelian randomization further revealed an inverse association between STAT1 levels and ASD risk. GEO transcriptomic data provided independent validation for the network pharmacology predictions. The binding energies between sulforaphane and the top 10 core targets are all ≤ -4.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulations further validated the stable interaction between MMP-9 and sulforaphane. Sulforaphane may serve as an efficacious and safe adjunctive therapy for ASD, mediated by its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects along with the modulation of autophagy. CRD42025635045.",

Sulforaphane (SFN), a phytochemical present in crucifers, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, yet its influences on immune cell activation as well as in graft survival are still unknown. Thus, the aim was to evaluate SFN's effect, and to improve efficacy, efficiency, and availability, it was incorporated into thermosensitive polymeric hydrogels, to prevent AR in skin transplant (Tx) model mice. A thermosensitive hydrogel containing SFN (0.1%) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (0.5%) dispersed in a poloxamer matrix (PL407 at 20% w/v) was developed (GS-PL407 20%, HA and SFN) and characterized as a liquid-viscous hydrogel. The fully MHC-incompatible skin Tx procedure was performed by using donor skin Balb/c mice, transplanted into C57BL/6 recipient mice. The cytotoxicity test of GS was performed using in vitro assays with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC). Treatment of BMDC with GS for 24 h presents no cytotoxicity. Untreated allograft mice present 100% of graft loss at day 9 post Tx. Remarkably, subcutaneous GS injection every 3 days promoted 80% of allograft survival for more than 14 days when compared with untreated recipients (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Histological analysis showed a lower level of inflammatory cells in the skin Tx of GS-treated mice. Flow cytometry analysis of draining lymph nodes at day 5 post Tx revealed that GS treatment reduced the frequency of DC and subtypes and function of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In vitro GS-treated lipopolysaccharide-activated BMDC present less activation of costimulatory markers. Taken together, GS treatment reduced immune cell activation, postponing AR onset and prolonging allograft survival in Tx animals.

The primary outcomes were changes in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and its subscales. Secondary outcomes included cognitive measures, metabolic markers, and safety. Four RCTs with 369 schizophrenia patients were included. Sulforaphane did not significantly improve PANSS total or positive symptom scores at the latest follow-up (ranging from 24 weeks to 18 weeks) or at a consistent 12-week time point.

Novel monovalent SFN-glycoconjugates with mannose (Man) and fucose (0Fuc) were developed and tested for their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties in DCs from healthy donors under chronic LPS exposure.
